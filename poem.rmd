In Harlem’s rhythm, where dreams take flight,  
A symphony of voices in the city’s night.  
Langston’s pen weaves tales of joy and pain,  
In verses vibrant, a poetic refrain.  
  
Through weary streets and avenues wide,  
He paints a portrait of life’s bumpy ride.  
The weary blues, a melody profound,  
Echoes of struggles in each heartfelt sound.  
  
Oh, rivers of dreams in a weary world,  
Where hope unfurls its banner, unfurled.  
In every line, a soul’s resilient song,  
A symphony of struggle, where we all belong.  
  
Harlem shadows, dancing to the beat,  
In Langston’s words, a vibrant feat.  
The weary blues find solace in his verse,  
An anthem for the downtrodden, a universe.  
  
The beauty in the mundane, the everyday,  
In every stanza, echoes of life’s ballet.  
Langston’s ink, a river flowing free,  
A poetic legacy for eternity.
